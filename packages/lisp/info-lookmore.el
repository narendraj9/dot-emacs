;;; Commentary:

;; This is some more manuals and a couple more mode setups for
;; `info-lookup-symbol'.
;;
;; Functions adding manuals are `interactive' so you can for example
;; `M-x info-lookmore-c-gcc' to see it just for the current session.
;;
;; More manuals can be added with `info-lookmore-add-doc' calls.  Usually
;; you have to find the node name of the index, then check whether entries
;; can be used directly or need mangling.  The easiest is when there's a
;; separate "Functions" or "Functions and Variables" index.  See docstring
;; of `info-lookup-alist' for the details.

;;; Emacsen:

;; Designed for Emacs 21 and up.  Works in XEmacs 21.
;; Doesn't work in Emacs 20 due to "append" parameter to `add-to-list'.

;;; Install:

;; Put info-lookmore.el in one of your `load-path' directories, and in your
;; .emacs add for each setup function you want,
;;
;;     (autoload 'info-lookmore-c-gcc "info-lookmore" nil t)
;;     (eval-after-load "info-look" '(info-lookmore-c-gcc))
;;
;; There's autoload cookies for the functions below if you install via
;; `M-x package-install' or know how to use `update-file-autoloads'.  Then
;; `eval-after-load' for each you want permanently, or M-x for one session.

;;; History:

;; Version 1 - the first version
;; Version 2 - new info-lookmore-coreutils-index
;; Version 3 - info-lookmore-c++-use-c correction to file setup
;;           - info-lookmore-coreutils-index do nothing in emacs21
;; Version 4 - new info-lookmore-makefile-derivatives
;; Version 5 - new info-lookmore-c-gsl
;; Version 6 - makeinfo single-quote variants
;; Version 7 - really end at "ends here", don't add-to-list on let binding
